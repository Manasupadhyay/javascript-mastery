    <!-- parse means reading -->
    <!-- different ways to add javascript in html  -->
    <!-- add script tag in head tag -->
    <!-- limitations -> browser parse the html file,when it found script tag it stops there and load js file, and stops parsing
     , after loading complete then browser execute the js file, and there we got errors , because in js file we have used html tags
    that are present in html file, but browser doesn't know about that, as we stops parsing in between to load js file
  so this method is not good -->
  <!-- add script as last element in body tag -->
<!-- limitation: as browser parse the html file, and after it complete parsing it found a scipt tag so it load it and then execute it
here it sucessfully execute it as html file is parse, it already know all the tags present in html file
but this method takes time, as 1. parsing of html file happen 2. then loading of js file 3. and finally execution of js file
 -->

  <!-- asynchronus methods -->
 <!-- add script tag in head tag with async attribute -->
 <!-- parse and load are done simultaneously but as soon as load done, now only execution take place and parsing stops -->
 <!-- limitation: browser parse the html file and found script tag, but due to async keyword, it will not stop parsing and 
load js file in background, and execute js file as soon as js file loads, due to this, html parsing will stop,
then it cause error during execution, it some tags were missing as html is only half parse -->

<!-- add script tag in head with defer attribute -->
<!-- in this, browser parse the html file, when script tag comes, it simultaneously load the js file
and when loading done, it wait for parsing to complete and when parsing is done, it start executing js file 
-->
<!-- it saves loading time of js file -->
<!-- this is best method -->
